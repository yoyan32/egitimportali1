                        <p class="card-text">The best way to start learning Python programming is to enroll in a course that covers the basics and helps you practice different coding concepts. Learning with an instructor is ideal because they can identify the areas where you need to improve and provide personalized guidance. Python's syntax and structure can be challenging at first, but with proper instruction and feedback, you can master it quickly. At our academy, we offer a comprehensive Python course led by expert instructors.</p>
